% File for sending anomaly e-mail messages. M-file consists of a function
% that does not provide an output parameter. It requires an 'id' input
% parameter that is used to detect unexpected faults (anomalies) associated
% with Vesna control.
%
% List of used functions
%   errors        - check the type of error that occurred. If an error
%                   occurs, it tries to resolve it and informs the user. It
%                   requires error 'id' and 'spec' parameters.
%   sendolmail    - specifies the structure of sending an e-mail. It
%                   requires parameters 'to' (recipient's e-mail address),
%                   'subject' (e-mail subject), 'body' (e-mail message).
%
% List of input variables
%   id            - identifier of the emerged fault (anomaly). Specifies
%                   the type of e-mail to send about the corresponding
%                   anomaly.
%
% List of local variables
%   subj          - type of the detected anomaly (e-mail subject).
%   msg           - description of the detected anomaly (e-mail message).
%   source        - sender's e-mail address.
%   destination   - recipient's e-mail address.
%   password      - sender's password.
%   setpref       - set preference of Outlook SMTP.
%   props         - set Outlook server properties.
